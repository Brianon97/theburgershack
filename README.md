<h3>Design Principles:</h3>

<h3>Responsiveness:</h3>
Bootstrap’s grid system ensures compatibility across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
Accessibility: ARIA labels (e.g., for social media links and carousel controls) and form validation enhance usability for screen readers.

Homepage: Features a carousel of dishes (burgers, pizzas, nachos, etc.) and a welcome message.
Deals Page: Displays meal deals with consistent card layouts for easy comparison.
Footer: Includes contact info, a Google Maps embed, and a contact form.


<h3>CSS Customizations:</h3>

Hover effects on buttons (e.g., #button transitions from orange red to black with orangered border and orangered text).
Social media icons have distinct borders (e.g., pink for Instagram, blue for Facebook).
Responsive card heights ensure uniformity across devices (e.g., min-height: 500px for tablets and up).


<h3>Tools Used:</h3>
HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for structure and styling and balsamic for wireframes.

<h2>Features</h2>
